GoogleBooksJP is a web app that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. It displays the search results in the form of cards, showing the book's title, author, and cover image. Users can also view more detailed information about a book by clicking on its card. In addition to displaying search results, GoogleBooksJP also includes a feature that allows users to create their own personal book library using Firestore. This allows them to save and organize their favorite books, and access them from any device. Overall, GoogleBooksJP is a convenient and user-friendly tool for finding and managing books.
